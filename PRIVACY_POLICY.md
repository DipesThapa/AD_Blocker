# AdBlock Ultra – Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 13, 2025

AdBlock Ultra does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal data. All functionality runs locally inside your browser.

- **Blocking statistics** (e.g., number of requests blocked) are kept locally and are never uploaded.
- **Network blocking** relies on Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API, which prevents requests without sending page information to external servers.
- The extension contains **no analytics, telemetry, or third-party tracking scripts**.

## Third Parties
AdBlock Ultra does not integrate with, or send data to, any external services or advertisers.
